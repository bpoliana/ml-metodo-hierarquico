On the common folk like me
Makin bets to what degree of fool we are
Through your rosecolored windows
You see yourself above us
Standin in the mud gazin at the stars
But the rich and poor have in common
The common cold the heartburn and the heartache
Put our pants on just the same
Your worth dont make you better babe
Cause I can tread water babe
As long as you think you make it rain
While you got your raisin girl
And your diamondstudded world
I got pulled up on the hungry side o town
I cut my teeth on bacon rind
There aint no hide as tough as mine
But it might be fun awhile to be your clown
So get your whip and do your thing
And Ill run around the ring
Ride my white horse wear my armor too
Ah but I dont easy blister babe
Ill be your court jester babe
Dont think you wont pay fiddler too
Aah I put your hand in mine
It was a shockin time to find
The water hot current strong deep and wet
You had me strugglin for a time
A draggin on your line
But never fear this fish will never swim
While youre playin with my mind
Ill be payin with your money honey
As long as your account can stand the drain
Ill fan the flame and make it hotter
Cause I think I can walk on water
As long as you can make it rain
Aww Ill hang around awhile
Study your style
Come out a whole lot wiser man indeed
Cause last time anyone as grand
As you appeared and looked around
Found the grandest star up in the East
Hey but I dont see no halo
Just a little girl with a lot of gold
Want one more trinket for her golden scene
Ah but you got a hot one hangin kid
Dont let him say you never did
You best be my guest make it rain
Aah make it rain
Babe make it rain
Make it rain
Oh make it rain",358.0

Opened up I wont confess
Pulled apart theyre four of me
Opened up an oddity
Changing with the times
Like rolling with the punches
Basing my decisions
On theories and hunches
All I ever wanted to do
Was move forward
Being pulled
Four directions at once
Drawn and quartered
Come apart at the seams
Opened up for all to see
Coming apart but I dont cry
Opened up but I wont bleed
I wont I wont bleed for
I wont I wont bleed for you
I wont let you see
Whats really inside me
Hidden somewhere in between
Buried beneath the skin and bone
Away rom the smiles which are lies
Ripped apart I just laugh
Opened up cant help but laugh
Torn open an open book
Opened up please dont look
I wont let you see
Whats really inside me
Hidden somewhere in between
Buried beneath the skin and bone
Away rom the smiles which are lies
Please dont please dont look at
Please dont please dont look at me

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some missletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with eyes all aglow
Who find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santas on his way
Hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mothers child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so Im offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninetyfour
Although its been said many times many ways

Youre a discontented mother and a rich inventive wife
Ive no doubt you dream about the things youll never do
But I wish someone had a talked to me like I wanna talk to you
Ooh Ive been to Georgia and California oh anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free
Ive been to paradise but Ive never been to me
Please lady please lady dont just walk away
Cause I have this need to tell you why Im all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
Wont you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies
Oh Ive been to Nice and the isle of Greece
While I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed em what Ive got
Ive been undressed by kings and Ive seen some things
That a woman aint sposed to see
Ive been to paradise but Ive never been to me
Hey you know what paradise is Its a lie A fantasy we create about
People and places as wed like them to be But you know what truth is
Its that little baby youre holding and its that man you fought with
This morning the same one youre going to make love with tonight
Thats truth thats love
Sometimes Ive been to cryin for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I I took the sweet life and never knew Id be bitter from the sweet
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that cost too much to be free
Hey lady Ive been to paradise but Ive never been to me

Some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington
Was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks
Her ruby lips
Like arrows pierced my breast
The name she bore was Flora
The Lily of the West
I came to my love Flora
Some pleasure there to find
She turned in to another man
Which sort of stressed my mind
She robbed me of my loyalty
Deprived me of my rest
I loved my faithless Flora
The Lily of the West
Now down in yonder shady grove
The man who was to come
Conversing with my Flora there
It seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him
It sort of me oppressed
I was betrayed by Flora
The Lily of the West
I stepped up to my rival
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar
And I boldly made him stand
We met in desperation
I pierced him in the breast
I killed the man for Flora

Loose lips is bigger than Jiggas a secret never sacred when youre making figures

Bring some redbulls and some Trojan extra large
Work a big chop she gon lose a lot of carbs
Make that juice box talk man I make that pussy fart

Caught up in my bullshit put your head on backwards
And skate off after engage in laughter bout what just happened
Fingers and napkins get sent to mammies is that too graphic
Catch you in traffic you sitting daffy like stealing candy
My ceilings absent my wheels are massive my friends assassins
All of us bastards our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid my fins are splashin my gills are flappin
I bend some matches then sip some gas and went kissed a dragon
Im really rappin Im finger snappin Im pistol packin
Yall niggas slippin my swag is drippin so heres a napkin
Whats really happnin bro
Verbal attackin Im showing passion
Know what I mean see Im the king like Im from Akron
Im going overboard somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks I always want the fat ones
Im so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer
Too many bitches too many blunts too many buttons
Not enough bullets them niggas buggin the squad is comin
AK on shoulder no shoulder shruggin aim at your nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and Magnus honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin like Kappas stompin Ill slap a junkie
Im having lunch with Italian Sonny dont ask the subject
Lord why you took Rabbit from me he say dont ask me nothing
Too many bodies too many bangers too many bundles
Not enough bullets these niggas buggin I heard they stung you
Its gon be trouble we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga dont even mumble
Im back to ballin Im in the back full of Magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready turkey spaghetti and Castrol oil
Thats codeine turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In 4 minutes Ill turn this into forensics in a foreign car with a foreign broad
Thats long winded paper long and you taking long you just dont get it
Hung the phone up and Satan told me want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi the summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin like Hi officer

I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle

A plate of salmon the Cayman Islands a stripper dancer
If I dont get the car first Ill have a temper tantrum
Im innovative I demonstrated this nigga played it
I dont care if you owe me a nick nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady eat her pussy then kiss the baby
Get situated get keys off table then leave her 80
I really made it get it maid Schwarzenegger
Wont wrestle niggas I spatula all you action figures

These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls they say fuck yeah
Im doing this shit like whatever

Oh come hear a story a stranger just told me
Of a woman who meant everything
So proud he once owned her but he has her no longer
For she wears another mans ring
He talked of the good time theyd had in the springtime
Before she was stolen away
He blamed her oh no none he said she was too young
And thats why she wanted to stray
We drank to her new love that it might be true love
Her future both happy and bright
With his eyes growing misty he drank down the whiskey
That was telling his story that night
And though he didnt even know me he told me all of his story
And not one single word did he say without pride
And then he asked me if I blamed her but oh when he named her
I wanted to run out and hide
How could I tell him the man that had dealt him
His sadness and sorrow was me
I ran from the table while I was still able
To hold back my own misery
And now a wonder comes to me that maybe he knew me
And he told me just so Id cry
But without his knowing my teardrops were flowing
For she had just told me goodbye",225.0

The world is so much colder
So I may just have to change alone
Im dying every second Im alive
Every second Im alive
Im trying to feed the fire that inside me
The fire thats inside
Im dying every second Im alive

It reminds me the scars made me stronger",327.0

Aber wo soll ich anfangen mein Kopf is randvoll
Was werd ich sagen und wie wird es wohl ankommen
Ich lass es darauf ankommen und will alles aufschreiben
Auf dass die Zeilen mir die Zweifel noch austreiben
Dann werd ich es laut sagen das wird dann nicht ausbleiben
Und werdet Ihr auch fragen sind das deine Aussagen
Wie kann ich mich raushalten Ich will es rausschreien
Will dieser Stille meine Stimme leihen
Und doch bin ich Werkzeug und nicht von Bedeutung
Nur ein kleiner Hinweis auf dem Weg der Erleuchtung

Aus dem Einklang lÃ¶st und zu Worten formt
Erschaffen wir all diese Welten und Wege
Und geben dem Leben Bedeutung und Form
Die Vorstellung bleibt unerschÃ¶pflich
Und aus ihr wird letztlich von jedem ein Bild definiert
Doch wir finden in ihr auch den Inhalt
Den Ursprung und Anfang von allem das existiert
Diese Welt ist nicht mehr als ein Spiegel
Vom Verstand verpackt und versiegelt
Doch solang wir nicht fragen âwas kriegen wir wieder
Sobald wir erliegen erlischt die Begierde
Und dann finden wir inneren Frieden
Durch wahre Hingabe in Liebe

Ein anderer Wanderer ein Mantra am Strand

Trat aus einer Stille an mich heran
Und sie gab mir die Hand hier entlang Traust du dich
Mach dir keine Gedanken deine Angst brauchst du nicht
Denn die Wahrheit sie findet sich im Zauber des Augenblicks
Der atemberaubend ist
HÃ¶r in dich hinein und hÃ¶r auf zu denken
Und du hÃ¶rst dich im Klang dieser Welt wieder selbst
Denn du bist und in dir spiegelt sich alles wider

And you dont even call no more
We dont barely keep in touch at all
And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now
After all the years we been down
aint no way no how this bullshit can be true
We family and aint a damn thing changed unless its you
So young so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went
So close almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on
Tissue to wipe my eyes and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood i did
Sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
And mine i survived it you ran the streets i 9 to 5d it
We grew up grew apart as time went by us then i blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold you touch its like ice
In your eyes is the look of resenment
I can sense it and i dont like it
It was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got burst
So i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
Before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste
Some bitch that i wasnt with i would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you dont get involved in it you was smokin the chron with her
Comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk
Like whyall was husband and wife or somethin
But me catchin you fuckin other niggas musta hurt you pride or somethin
cause you wont fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all i tried to do was show your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
You actin like i aint you man and lyin like she cant be loose
But i am really you friend im jus trying to tell you the truth
But dont hate the game or the player
cause the one that is changing is you
Youre only at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
Homies in the hood only she be on the tube
Only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who
Fools i used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin and poof it jus happen
But PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned
Shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends
Whenever real intelligence thats forever till the end
I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
And wastin my times with these snakes in disguise
how come when you talk its with bitter is fight
And how come its my fault for what you did with your life
And everytime i go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace you cant even look me in my face",604.0

Horizons macabres je te le dis  mes comparses ont la dalle
Ãtudient Tony Montana 250 lorsquils montent Ã  Dam
On donne le spectacle au public on rÃ¨gle nos comptes Ã  part
On reste indomptable et incompris comme le monde arabe
Sous drogue douce tise on veut plus dun job pour lSMIC
On sait ce que le monde peut offrir on veut quil nous loffre tout de suite
Ils ont trop dmaille et pas assez didÃ©e on a trop didÃ©es pas assez dmaille
On est fait pour sentendre ou pour saccager lbal
Investisseur en vetsur de ceux qui cherchent des rÃ©sultats pas de ceux qui cherchent des excuses
Nique le minimum jveux faire plus
Jdois ramener la bebom

Car amour propre et sexe sale font rarement bon mÃ©nage

Et si elle a une gueule de cul il faut que son cul ait de la gueule
Connaissent pas notre vie connaissent pas nos peurs

Trop lourd pour que je me fasse soulever souvent sur la paille

I dont love you anymore like the way I did before
And since youve found someone new I think its best
I dont try and walk the floor I dont love you anymore
Trouble is I dont love you any less
I dont love you anymore for Ive got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying oer and oer I dont love you anymore
Trouble is I dont love you any less
I held you close to me one time I kissed your lips and called you mine
But another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I dont love you anymore

And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time
You been gone so long that its hard to recall just how the dream went
And all but this broken heart and me I guess is doing fine
Is it still over are we still through
Since my phone still aint ringing
I assume it still aint you
Ill have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But Im not sure that Im still over you
That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth
And half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of good prevention
And trying to explain while Im insane is the hardest thing Ive ever tried to do
Is it still over are we still through
Since my phone still aint ringing
I assume it still aint you
Ill have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But Im not sure that Im still over you
Is it still over are we still through

Im staying busy
Tied up enough so I dont have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself I do a oneeighty
I stay up clean the house
At least Im not drinking
Run around just so I dont have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets
Hes fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
If I was my heart
Id rather be restless
The second I stop the sleep catches up
And Im breathless
Cause this ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him before him I
Its all I can do to assure him assure him
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light
Hes fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone",240.0
